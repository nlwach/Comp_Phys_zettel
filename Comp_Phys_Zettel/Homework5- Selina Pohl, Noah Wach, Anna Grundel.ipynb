    "## Exercise 5\n",

    "More specifically, we are going to solve a linear system of equations with a tridiagonal NxN matrix.\n",

    "#### 1. Gaussian elimination\n",
    "At first we implement a method to use the Gaussian elimination on a matrix. This is important since it gives us a triangular matrix in row-echelon form.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If we have a problem of the form Ax=b with A as a matrix, x and b vectors and we're looking for x, we have to apply the same steps of calculation on b as we do on A.  \n",
    "To do this more efficiently we trianglify a new matrix, which is simply the original matrix A with the vector b added as a new column."
